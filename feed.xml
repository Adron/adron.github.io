      <title>Code First Docs How we Threw Out The Book &amp; Put Code First With Twilio Documentation by Jarod Reyes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jarod is alarmingly disinterested in “how things are done”. He spent much of his grade school years disrupting class, running social experiments and singing love ballads to his teachers. Nowadays he can be found working with an exceptional team of developers at Twilio who are laser-focused on improving the landscape of developer documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jarod describes Code First Docs as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “My job at Twilio is straightforward, write documentation that doesn’t suck. This may seem fairly straightforward, but it turns out to be harder than an &lt;a href=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4048/4353601145_5c12467871_b.jpg&quot;&gt;Atari 2600 cartridge&lt;/a&gt;. For the last 30 years we have asked developers to do their jobs by equipping them with essentially giant books that we have adapted to the internet age by simply putting them on the web. At Twilio we weren’t satisfied with this traditional approach so we threw out the book and challenged some basic assumptions about creating documentation for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; What is the journey of the modern developer? How does documentation fit into their flow? Are there ways to create documentation that enables developers to work smarter, as opposed to interrupting their day? We’ll discuss these questions and more as I share how we got to the realization that we needed a documentation revolution; this is the story of how we raised up code to be the supreme leader of documentation.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ops for Devs by Adam Ulvi</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Node applications exist at the end of a long, somewhat magical series of tubes. What spells are being cast to make this all work? Let’s find out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk Adam will explore the steps required to host a Node application on a small, affordable linux virtual private server (like a DigitalOcean droplet). This is not a tutorial, but rather, a walk-through of the configuration steps, background information the role each step plays, and the “why” behind the choices we are making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference implementation is taken from the current production gruntjs.com server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By following the request lifecyle, we will touch on basic tcp/ip networking, DNS configuration and history, node application development, nginx proxy configuration, and basic linux system configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the presentation developers should have a better understanding of the simple application’s infrastructure requirements, external dependencies, and targets of opportunity for future improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spock and I are excited to announce our first set of speakers for &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodepdx.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Node PDX 2016&lt;/a&gt;, which you’ve seen slowly coming out each day! I hope you’re ready and have your &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodepdx.org/#tickets&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tickets&lt;/a&gt; bought already. So far I’ve introduced &lt;a href=&quot;https://compositecode.com/2016/05/18/node-pdx-2016-speaker-tomomi-imura-aka-girlie_mac/&quot;&gt;Tomomi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://compositecode.com/2016/05/19/node-pdx-2016-speaker-jonny-oropeza/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://compositecode.com/2016/05/24/node-pdx-2016-speaker-liz-abinante/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Liz&lt;/a&gt;. Today I’ll introduce Adam Ulvi a bit later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve also announced the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodepdx.org/lagniappe.html#geektrain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Geek Train for Node PDX&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodepdx.org/lagniappe.html#bikes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Node PDX Bike Ride&lt;/a&gt;. A little &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lagniappe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lagniappe&lt;/a&gt; if you will.  ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/articles/speakers-and-more-for-node-pdx-2016/spock-horns.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spock&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nodepdx.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Node PDX 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Geek Train&lt;/strong&gt; provides super cheap $15 train fare from anywhere north of Portland along the Amtrak Cascades route. I’ll actually meet the train in Seattle and ride from Seattle back to Portland for the conference. How that works is if you’re in Bellingham, Everett, Seattle, Tacoma, or wherever along the northern stretch can &lt;a href=&quot;https://ti.to/nodepdx/nodepdx-2016/with/gl6purbdlmo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;purchase a ticket from us here&lt;/a&gt;. Once you purchase a ticket we’ll all have tickets for a specific train and will board along the line and join up in a specific car on the train (which we’ll have assigned day of the trip).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;bike ride&lt;/strong&gt; will make a loop through west and east of the Willamette River with a chance to check out all sorts of parts of the city. We’ll stop and try some of the wicked tasty locally roasted coffee and roll into one of the local taprooms that has dozens of local brews on tap. Between those tasty beverages I’ll point out some of the most excellent architecture, bridge design (ya like bridges eh?), neighborhoods, and other things that are characteristic of Portland. This will be a slow ride, so no need to have alley cat like reflexes and riding skills, just come and enjoy a chill, casual, and fun slow ride through Portland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dotnetfringe.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;.NET Fringe 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For .NET Fringe we’ll have the announcements for speakers coming very soon. We’ve taken a slightly different approach with a voting mechanism among organizers which we’ll be wrapping up and then will hurry up with the announcement, I know everybody needs to know ASAP!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll also be setting up a Geek Train &amp;amp; .NET Fringe bike ride too, we’ve just got to get everything posted. So keep an eye on the .NET Fringe site or &lt;a href=&quot;http://dotnetfringe.org/#signup&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;subscribe to updates&lt;/a&gt; and it’ll have updates popping up real soon.&lt;/p&gt;
