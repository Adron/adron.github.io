      <title>The Web Platform is the Universal Instrument by Ben Michel</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/articles/node-pdx-2016-speaker-ben-michel/nodepdx-2016-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Node PDX 2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Michel has a pretty epic talk scheduled for Node PDX… if you don’t know Ben he’s a Musician–Developer. He composes &amp;amp; performs live soundtracks and cares a lot about community music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk he has planned for you all is described as, “Music as an idea, expression, commercial endeavor, and communal art is in its most volatile state since the European Renaissance. We’ve moved from the public adoption of recording technology, through the massive rise and fall of the recording industry, to a new age that was first seeded at Bell Labs during the Computer Science era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;liz.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max Mathews encouraged a generation of computer musicians by declaring the Nyquist-Shannon “sampling theorem shows that there are really no limits to the sounds you can make…the computer is a universal musical instrument.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with a fuller understanding of what Mathews was implying, we can take it a step further and say that the Browser is the universal musical instrument. It’s the most accessible, cross-compatible runtime yet–and with the growth of Web Audio and Web MIDI standardization, we’re on the verge of a new renaissance in musical collaboration and interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the promotion of individualism in our popular culture, and the divide between developers and working artists has kept us from realizing the potential of building useful tools for distributed music collaboration, even in the web platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I can see a world coming where community music and recorded works are not identified by regional boundaries, but distributed data regions and organic peer to peer networks. If the development of Web Audio and it’s supporting standards stabilize, music collaboration and exposition could be made available to everyone with no hinderances from age, class, or personal ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WebSound project is my iterative solution to this problem through long-term community engagement, and Audio/MIDI tool versioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first endeavor is to build a few useful live performance tools enabling remote collaboration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real-time Web MIDI performances streamed to a live-event, enabling the performer to lead songs or compositions remotely. Achieved through an optimized VPN and P2P WebRTC DataChannels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communally performed live music making with MIDI controlled WebAudio and WebSocket broadcasting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audience interaction with the exposed parameters of a live band’s instrumentation–via broadcast methods and microcontroller installations.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>I Play the JavaScript by Matt McKegg</title>
      <link>http://adron.github.io/articles/node-pdx-2016-speaker-matt-mckegg/</link>

&lt;p&gt;A JavaScript hacker and backyard musician and from Wellington, New Zealand. Lover of all things open and modular. I spend most of my time pressing buttons of various shapes, sizes and colours. Sometimes these buttons make sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt has been making music with computers for about 10 years, but once he tried to move from bedroom composing to live performance, he got incredibly frustrated at how hard it was to play computer music live. He decided to start working on his own live electronic performance software written in JavaScript that would let me play the way he wanted to play. 3 years later, it’s finally starting to become a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one of the Matt’s recent performances, for your viewing pleasure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artur describes himself as, “I’m a web developer and traveler. I write stories about my adventures in Russian and English on my site: &lt;a href=&quot;http://arturpaikin.com&quot;&gt;http://arturpaikin.com&lt;/a&gt; and run a small technology cooperative called &lt;a href=&quot;http://unebaguette.com&quot;&gt;Baguette&lt;/a&gt;, where I work on cool projects, currently building an ambitious next generation file uploader with &lt;a href=&quot;https://transloadit.com/&quot;&gt;Transloadit&lt;/a&gt;. I ride a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/xC0qC2SSYb&quot;&gt;foldable bicycle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://unebaguette.com/web-course/&quot;&gt;teach&lt;/a&gt; web development and sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/4_6LO8ySVL/&quot;&gt;garden&lt;/a&gt; on the balcony.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;art-stida.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: right;margin-left: 15px;margin-top: 15px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artur has built an open source home automation system called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/arturi/kotihome&quot;&gt;Koti Home&lt;/a&gt; (Koti means home in Finnish language). It’s powered by an Arduino connected to Raspberry Pi, MQTT protocol for messaging, Node.js on the client and server, web sockets. You can interact with Koti robot via a React (like the cool kids do) control panel, Telegram Chat Bot and even your own voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthur will talk about how he’s turned this project into reality — the tech he used and the challenges he faced. From a blinking LED to a voice controlled home automation robot.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Code First Docs How we Threw Out The Book &amp; Put Code First With Twilio Documentation by Jarod Reyes</title>
      <link>http://adron.github.io/articles/node-pdx-2016-speaker-jarod-reyes/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2016 17:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/articles/node-pdx-2016-speaker-jarod-reyes/nodepdx-2016-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Node PDX 2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jarod is alarmingly disinterested in “how things are done”. He spent much of his grade school years disrupting class, running social experiments and singing love ballads to his teachers. Nowadays he can be found working with an exceptional team of developers at Twilio who are laser-focused on improving the landscape of developer documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;jarodreyes.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: right;margin-left: 15px;margin-top: 15px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jarod describes Code First Docs as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My job at Twilio is straightforward, write documentation that doesn’t suck. This may seem fairly straightforward, but it turns out to be harder than an &lt;a href=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4048/4353601145_5c12467871_b.jpg&quot;&gt;Atari 2600 cartridge&lt;/a&gt;. For the last 30 years we have asked developers to do their jobs by equipping them with essentially giant books that we have adapted to the internet age by simply putting them on the web. At Twilio we weren’t satisfied with this traditional approach so we threw out the book and challenged some basic assumptions about creating documentation for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the journey of the modern developer? How does documentation fit into their flow? Are there ways to create documentation that enables developers to work smarter, as opposed to interrupting their day? We’ll discuss these questions and more as I share how we got to the realization that we needed a documentation revolution; this is the story of how we raised up code to be the supreme leader of documentation.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ops for Devs by Adam Ulvi</title>
      <link>http://adron.github.io/articles/node-pdx-2016-speaker-adam-ulvi/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Node applications exist at the end of a long, somewhat magical series of tubes. What spells are being cast to make this all work? Let’s find out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk Adam will explore the steps required to host a Node application on a small, affordable linux virtual private server (like a DigitalOcean droplet). This is not a tutorial, but rather, a walk-through of the configuration steps, background information the role each step plays, and the “why” behind the choices we are making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;adamulvi.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: right;margin-left: 15px;margin-top: 15px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference implementation is taken from the current production gruntjs.com server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By following the request lifecyle, we will touch on basic tcp/ip networking, DNS configuration and history, node application development, nginx proxy configuration, and basic linux system configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the presentation developers should have a better understanding of the simple application’s infrastructure requirements, external dependencies, and targets of opportunity for future improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Speakers and More For Node PDX 2016</title>
      <link>http://adron.github.io/articles/speakers-and-more-for-node-pdx-2016/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spock and I are excited to announce our first set of speakers for &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodepdx.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Node PDX 2016&lt;/a&gt;, which you’ve seen slowly coming out each day! I hope you’re ready and have your &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodepdx.org/#tickets&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tickets&lt;/a&gt; bought already. So far I’ve introduced &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.adron.me/articles/node-pdx-2016-speaker-tomomi-imura/&quot;&gt;Tomomi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.adron.me/articles/node-pdx-2016-speaker-jonny-oropeza/&quot;&gt;Jon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.adron.me/articles/node-pdx-2016-speaker-liz-abinante/&quot;&gt;Liz&lt;/a&gt;. Today I’ll introduce Adam Ulvi a bit later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve also announced the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodepdx.org/lagniappe.html#geektrain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Geek Train for Node PDX&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodepdx.org/lagniappe.html#bikes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Node PDX Bike Ride&lt;/a&gt;. A little &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lagniappe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lagniappe&lt;/a&gt; if you will.  ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.adron.me/articles/node-pdx-2016-speaker-tomomi-imura/&quot;&gt;Tomomi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.adron.me/articles/node-pdx-2016-speaker-jonny-oropeza/&quot;&gt;Jon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://adron.github.io/articles/speakers-and-more-for-node-pdx-2016/&quot;&gt;Liz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/articles/speakers-and-more-for-node-pdx-2016/spock-horns.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spock&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nodepdx.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Node PDX 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Geek Train&lt;/strong&gt; provides super cheap $15 train fare from anywhere north of Portland along the Amtrak Cascades route. I’ll actually meet the train in Seattle and ride from Seattle back to Portland for the conference. How that works is if you’re in Bellingham, Everett, Seattle, Tacoma, or wherever along the northern stretch can &lt;a href=&quot;https://ti.to/nodepdx/nodepdx-2016/with/gl6purbdlmo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;purchase a ticket from us here&lt;/a&gt;. Once you purchase a ticket we’ll all have tickets for a specific train and will board along the line and join up in a specific car on the train (which we’ll have assigned day of the trip).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;bike ride&lt;/strong&gt; will make a loop through west and east of the Willamette River with a chance to check out all sorts of parts of the city. We’ll stop and try some of the wicked tasty locally roasted coffee and roll into one of the local taprooms that has dozens of local brews on tap. Between those tasty beverages I’ll point out some of the most excellent architecture, bridge design (ya like bridges eh?), neighborhoods, and other things that are characteristic of Portland. This will be a slow ride, so no need to have alley cat like reflexes and riding skills, just come and enjoy a chill, casual, and fun slow ride through Portland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dotnetfringe.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;.NET Fringe 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For .NET Fringe we’ll have the announcements for speakers coming very soon. We’ve taken a slightly different approach with a voting mechanism among organizers which we’ll be wrapping up and then will hurry up with the announcement, I know everybody needs to know ASAP!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll also be setting up a Geek Train &amp;amp; .NET Fringe bike ride too, we’ve just got to get everything posted. So keep an eye on the .NET Fringe site or &lt;a href=&quot;http://dotnetfringe.org/#signup&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;subscribe to updates&lt;/a&gt; and it’ll have updates popping up real soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.adron.me/articles/node-pdx-2016-speaker-liz-abinante/knitting.png&quot; class=&quot;image float-left&quot; /&gt;Liz Abinante lives in Portland, Oregon and works as a Senior Software Engineer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://newrelic.com/&quot;&gt;New Relic&lt;/a&gt;. She is infectiously enthusiastic about web development, teaching, learning, and feminism. She used to write JavaScript, then walked up to the wrong desk one day and now she writes some Java too. She enjoys speaking at conferences, knitting, sewing, and a hacking away on interesting problems. She swears she’s a lot more interesting than this bio makes her sound. She’s often been compared to cartoon characters due to her enormous personality and penchant for singing and/or dancing her way through life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;liz.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liz’s presentation is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Foolish Quest: Creating Knitting Patterns Using JavaScript&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The talk will show taking something real-world and math-based, like knitting, and turning into a program is actually super easy (no one is surprised here). But! What happens when you combine that with best practices and expected conventions, along with industry-wide standards for design and presentation? Things get a lot more complicated than just crunching numbers, especially when your output will result in lots of manual hours for people creating a real object. This is the story of how Liz built a customizable knitting pattern generator in JavaScript (after she’d built it in Ruby first, of course), and the lessons learned when you try and do math for more than just math’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join the Node PDX Conference by &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodepdx.org/#tickets&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;buying a ticket&lt;/a&gt; and come check out Liz’s presentation!&lt;/p&gt;

Jon Oropeza is a full-stack engineer at HD Quote Center, a post-aquisition startup solving tricky ecommerce problems for their parent company, The Home Depot. Prior to that, he designed and developed software for the insurance industry with his partners at LifePro Financial Services, and also co-founded a deep learning / computer vision oriented startup called Tilt Video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;jon.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image float-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon will be presenting “&lt;strong&gt;Isomorphic Business Logic (Or How to convince even the most die-hard C#/Java/Rails-on-the-Backend boss that you need to run a node server)&lt;/strong&gt;“ which might just be the talk with the longest title of the conference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business logic is all the tricky calculations, rules and transformations that never seem to be in the hot new framework’s example ToDo app. Lately I’ve been finding it’s also the key to convincing clients and bosses that they NEED to run a node layer, no matter what other backend techs they happen to be rocking. In this talk I’ll dive into why and how, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An intro to isomorphic javascript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenges that arise from wanting a performant client and server-side verification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How this gets exacerbated if you happen to be using a microservices-based backend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business logic - that pesky stuff that isn’t in the ToDo App&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Story time: A real world example of an app trying to apply the same logic in 2 different languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isomorphic business logic to the rescue!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The close… How all of this translates to ‘you need to run a node server’ :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come check out Jon’s talk at &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodepdx.org/#tickets&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Node PDX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m stoked to introduce Tomomi (&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/girlie_mac&quot;&gt;@girlie_mac&lt;/a&gt;). Tomomi is an avid open web &amp;amp; open technology advocate and creative technologist, who had been active in the mobile space for past 8+ years. Now she is working at PubNub in San Francisco. When she is not at work, she still geeks around and hacks some stuff like Amazon Dash to Rickroll people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomomi will be presenting “&lt;strong&gt;From Software to Hardware: How Do I Track My Cat with JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the era of Internet of Things, connecting things to the mobile devices and web is becoming ubiquitous. You can control room light using your mobile phone. You can monitor your heart rate and weight on browser. JavaScript engineers like you already have skills to prototype ideas to build software, so why not hardware too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomomi, a front-end engineer with no background in electrical engineering, tells how she got started with hardware hacking with JavaScript, also talks about her recent fun project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/girliemac/RPi-KittyCam&quot;&gt;KittyCam&lt;/a&gt;, a Raspberry Pi camera with cat facial detection to see when her cat Jamie is eating while being away from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in seeing Tomomi speak, get registered for &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodepdx.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Node PDX before the tickets are gone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
