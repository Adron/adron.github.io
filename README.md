# adron.github.io infrastructure

This is the information for how I've got my Google Cloud resources setup via Terraform. This information is of course, not really something you can run independently of my account, but provides effective examples of what I've gotten setup for my own use.

The datadiluvium.com domain Terraform files are located in the Data Diluvium Project repository under the [infrastructure directory](https://github.com/Adron/datadiluvium/tree/master/infrastructure).
