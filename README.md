This is the information for how I've got my Google Cloud resources setup via Terraform. This information is of course, not really something you can run independently of my account, but provides effective examples of what I've gotten setup for my own use.

The `terraform-packer-install-scripts` directory has scripts specifically for installing Terraform 0.6.16 and Packer 0.10.1 on OS-X and Ubuntu.

The `scripts` directory has the elastic.sh and run-remote.sh files which are used for installations.
