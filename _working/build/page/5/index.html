<p>I’m stoked to introduce Tomomi (<a href="http://twitter.com/girlie_mac">@girlie_mac</a>). Tomomi is an avid open web <span class="amp">&amp;</span> open technology advocate and creative technologist, who had been active in the mobile space for past 8+ years. Now she is working at PubNub in San Francisco. When she is not at work, she still geeks around and hacks some stuff like Amazon Dash to Rickroll&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>Tomomi will be presenting “<strong>From Software to Hardware: How Do I Track My Cat with JavaScript</strong>“.</p>

                        <p class="blog-grid-excerpt"><p><em>[<strong><span class="caps">NOTE</span>:</strong> This was actually written Thursday the 5<span class="ord">th</span>, things make more sense with that in&nbsp;mind.]</em></p>
<p>I sat here today, and several normal things happened that made me think of some seriously important things. The thoughts are presented very well by Scott Hanselman in a talk on <em>scaling oneself</em>. He’s got a lot of gems in this presentation (links and video below), which he’s given a few times. In those presentations he makes a few very quotable statements that I had pop into my&nbsp;mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s not what you read, it’s what you ignore.” - Scott&nbsp;Hanselman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other really great gem&nbsp;is,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Sometimes <em><strong>dropping the ball</strong></em> is the right thing to do.”  - Scott&nbsp;Hanselman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of these are so true. It’s an important balancing act that one must perform to maintain a high level of productivity, especially in any complex work. Seriously, even digging a ditch can be complex, just look at Boston. They spent the years 1982 through 2002 to work on this project. They failed a dozen times on a dozen aspects of the project. It barely finished even a percentage of what was intended all for an initial estimate that was $2.8 Billion that ended up being $14.8 billion (only $8.08 Billion in 1982 dollars though :o ). In this situation, just to finish, the city had to actually drop the ball on a number of aspects of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig" target="_blank">Big Dig</a>.</p>
<p>But I digress, my problems I’m working on solutions for aren’t anywhere near the dilemma of the Big Dig. I do however find myself needing to chose between becoming swamped and living life, or dropping the ball. If I chose carefully I can still succeed even while dropping the ball on some things. Because sometimes it is indeed, the right thing to&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>An alternative,<strong> delegate </strong>and get&nbsp;help.</p>
<p>Another solution to dropping the ball or not dropping the ball, is to simply delegate and pass the ball to others who can help out. Both <em>dropping the ball</em> and <em>delegating</em> are honestly great leadership skills that can be harnessed to effectively multiply your productivity levels. Both of them can seem almost like the same thing to those that have expectations upon your work, and both can be force multipliers for you, but their results can obviously be very different initially. In the end, both end up requiring someone to pick up the work or write off the work. I’ll leave you to guess which one results in which result.&nbsp;;)</p>
<p>As these things popped into my head I looked at my immediate to-do list of things. I knew I was rather bombarded with things I needed to do, so it was time to figure out what could be delegated and what could be dropped. This list, of course is only <em>tech related</em> and <em>work</em> related. It is also a list that has to be done before the end of the week, which is Sunday @ 6pm in time for Game of Thrones for this particular&nbsp;instance.</p>

<li><span class="caps">PDX</span> Node - (Not PDX Node and not Node PDX!) meetup tonight (Thursday) at Urban Airship to plan the future of the meetup and coordinate with&nbsp;organizers!</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, that’s enough. You get the idea. I’m a bit underwater on things. But this is how it works. There are weeks where there isn’t a high priority on a single thing, and then <span class="caps">BOOM</span>, the deluge has come upon me and I have no hope of finishing things in a timely manner. Privatization, delegation, and dropping the ball are the options available during this&nbsp;time.</p>
<p><strong>Question Things, Question Yourself, Always Ask&nbsp;Questions</strong></p>
<p>I always ask several questions about things I need to get done during this time. For instance, how could I get help or even get someone to organize a bike ride or do the work of setting up logistics around the geek train? How could I make the amount of work I need to do to setup the <span class="caps">DNS</span> migration and complete it the absolute minimum while ensuring it’ll get done right, on time, and seamlessly without interruption? Could I just drop the Zookeeper and Kubernetes work for now? There is always a balance to be reached among things that provides the maximum&nbsp;return.</p>
<p>Among all the questions there are two other things that are super important. Again, I’m going to pull a Hanselman&nbsp;quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Effectiveness is doing the right thing.
Efficiency is doing things right.  - <em>Scott&nbsp;Hanselman</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These two things are huge. If either falters, even in a small way, I’ve found it’s better to call a full stop and reflect on what I’m doing. I’ve also found, that when others start to give in and their efficiency and effectiveness drops, it’s time to call a full stop. This is something that’s hugely helpful when providing leadership for people too, help them help you help everybody move forward and don’t let them fall prey to be overworked and&nbsp;overwhelmed!</p>
<p>These are a few things, largely focused around Scott’s blog entries and presentations. Absolutely great, well researched, and he practices what he preaches. Scott is a seriously kick ass, highly reliable, consistent&nbsp;guy.</p>
<p>On to some other things that Scott might have said, but these are things I’ve come up with just from life. The following might actually seem counter-intuitive, but I promise you when these practices are mastered you will stand out strong while others falter around you. However they’re tricky, because if you have a “warm body in seat” type of boss, don’t have work flexibility around hours, schedule, remote or onsite all of these become extremely difficult. In spite of this they’re all wroth investing in to get them to work for you. I’ve easily quadrupled what I can do by doing the&nbsp;following.</p>
<p><h1>My Productivity&nbsp;List</h1>
Remember one thing. Work is not your core focus and reason to exist in life. <strong><em>You, your family, your love is why you work in order to live and to create and build</em></strong>. Don’t get these things mixed up ever. If work takes to much toll, figure something out to reduce it’s damage to your&nbsp;life.</p>
