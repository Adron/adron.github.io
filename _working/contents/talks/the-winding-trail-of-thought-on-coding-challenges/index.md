## A Story of Getting Things Done
*@ [Seattle JS](https://www.meetup.com/seattlejs/) on TBD*

*The Talk:* In this talk, I will walk through several JavaScript coding challenges. The mental flow and anguish between choices and implication of those choices as I move through and grow the code base. After a few challenges I'll expand on and turn those challenges into some real life implementations for services and apps. I'll also involve the audience in improving the ideas, ruminate on code for brainstorming, and show a flow between coder mind and the cohort. In the end, I hope to bring a little bit of the joy of coding to people.

*Me:* I’m a jovial, proactive, test & code, code & test, get things done well, software architect, engineer, code monkey, coder, and distributed systems advocate. Some of the things I’ve enjoyed doing over the years; coder, founder, tech recon, and messenger.
