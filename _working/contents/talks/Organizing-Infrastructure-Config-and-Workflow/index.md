## Organizing Infrastructure Config and Workflow
### *@ [HashiConf 2016](https://www.hashiconf.com/)*

**Abstract:**

When starting with the various products Terraform, Packer, Vagrant, and others, it isn't always apparent where and in what way one should organize the actual project. In this talk I'd like to delve into what I've done to organize solutions for development, production, and related pipelines. I'll talk from my point of view and what I've seen others do to keep their workloads organized and their infrastructure and application pipelines clean and well organized.
