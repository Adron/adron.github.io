## [Terraforming your Development + Adopting Kx Technology](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Scalability-Meetup/events/237772278/)
*@ [Seattle Scalability](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Scalability-Meetup/) on 11-29-2017*

Here's my slide deck for the talk tonight. As with many of my talks, I'll be heavy on the demo & actual use of the tool, so the slide deck is pretty minimal. For more on Terraform I'll have some blog entries coming and a video course coming early in 2018! :)
