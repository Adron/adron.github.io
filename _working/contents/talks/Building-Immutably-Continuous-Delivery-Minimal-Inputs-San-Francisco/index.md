## Building Immutably Continuous Delivery Minimal Inputs San Francisco
### *@ 2016-07-02 by Adron Hall*

This workshop focuses on building a continuously delivered pipeline using Node.js (however easily transferable to Ruby/Rails/Java/Scala/.NET etc.). The workshop will trace the steps from inception to deployed application (with a domain pointed appropriately and all) that can then be developed against to continue whatever effort and intent of the developer(s)!

* Learn about key parts: Application, Domain Name, Infrastructure, Integration, & Delivery
* Build an Application: Steps for building & actually building a simple Node.js Application to deploy.
* Getting a domain name, determining name servers & DNS servers, setting it up and getting it pointed at our application.
* Setting up and determining the deployment scenario on AWS & discussion of other infrastructure choices.
* Deploying the application through the complete process of code, integrate, test, build, deploy.
