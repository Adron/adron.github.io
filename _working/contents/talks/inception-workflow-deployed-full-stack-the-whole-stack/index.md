## The Fullstack LOL, How About the Whole Stack!
*@ [TBD]() on TBD*

In this talk I go through the steps of full stack deployment with and tech (demo w/ .NET/Go/Node.js, I'll have all three) of immutable infrastructure. Using Azure + Terraform + Google Cloud Platform I'll show the quickness of getting a full dev environment (that's CI/CD/Git+more) built, deployed, and the initial code written to deploy micro-services plus front end site using each of the aforementioned technologies. It's a whirlwind of a talk, showing how modern tooling can be used to truly simplify and empower getting a development team moving fast!
