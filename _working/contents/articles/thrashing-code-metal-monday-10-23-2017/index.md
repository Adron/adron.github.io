This has been a ridiculously productive Monday. I've got a lot of communications kicked off and some continued on a number of key points of business. I've also been involved with editing, writing, and getting a number blog entries posted today besides this one.

* [Build a Kubernetes Cluster on Google Cloud Platform with Terraform](http://blog.adron.me/articles/terraform-kubernetes-gcp/) - even though I wrapped it up last night I saved it for a final edit run this morning. That published super early.
* [Speaking, Follow Up, and Improving](https://medium.com/@adron/speaking-follow-up-and-improving-a5e5d205d2af) - Next up was this post where I outlined my mission when presenting, and what I aim to accomplish with every presentation I give.
* [A Modern Cross-Platform approach to µServices in .NET](https://www.pelo.tech/blog/2017/10/19/full-stack-c-services-restgrpc-apollo-graphql-and-reactjs) - Then I did a final edit pass on and worked with Joachim @ [Pelotech](https://pelo.tech) to get this article published. He's got some really great material coming on the tail of this one too. C#, REST Services, microservice style implementation, GRPC, graphql, reactjs, and more.
* [Big Ole Invisible Freight Railroads (Let’s Talk Volumes)](https://medium.com/@adron/big-ole-invisible-freight-railroads-lets-talk-volumes-5f159d563194) - In my search for freight shipments data, I wrote a piece on my efforts to find, and eventually fumble through not finding the granularity of data that I needed.

Now I'm kicking back and chilling for a few on the couch and it was just time for some relaxing metal tunes. These are different then the ones I often post, which tend toward waking up and kicking off Monday with attitude. But before diving into the metal this grand Monday, let's talk about a code challenge shall we?

## Code challenge

Alright, imagine a recent problem where [currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying) is in play. Then combine that with a problem with which you would use an [anonymous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function) to solve a problem.

Now using one language, implement a sample of each in that one language and post a gist. Rewards this week are a Thrashing Code sticker plus one beverage of your choice. I'll actually send you ONE beverage of your choice. Ok, I won't sent you [Glenmorangie Pride from 81](https://www.reservebar.com/glenmorangie-pride-1981-single-malt-whisky), but something like a 6 pack of [Black Boss Porter](https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/5504/17055/) or your choice [Viso](http://drinkviso.com/) if that's your thing. It's easy, take a stab at it!

Now for your listening pleasure, some grand, relaxing, chill evening metal.

...and I like to work in threes, so here's that third gem...

Until next time, happy code thrashing!
