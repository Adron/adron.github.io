Alright, I'm gonna have some extremely blunt things stated in this email, that have the loaded context that I've done extensive studies, analysis, and related research into urban spaces, planning, roadway design, cycling as a mode of transportation, transit, etc. Some of you probably know me well enough to know that, so these comments won't come as a surprise. To mix in the tech however, this is a follow on to my coverage of OSCON from yesterday.

This blog entry should and could be used for informing decisions when traveling for tech events. Some of the suggestions might be a no brainer, others might add to your notions of what to do and how to travel to these events. Toward the end of this blog entry I've broken down these suggestions into: Speaker Adventures, Attendee Adventures, and Staffing Adventures. Before that, the low down on things in Austin.

## Visiting Austin, Learning About, and Exploring

Austin is one of the gems of the south. It's up there with the extreme few walkable places of Atlanta, the core of Charlotte or Wilmington, North Carolina, and a few other places. I'll add the caveat that all of these cities have heat, sun, and humidity that will make any non-residents of the south buckle at the knees and feel as thought they've been solid punched in the chest. I ***do not say this lightly, if you've not been punched in the chest you may be very unprepared to deal with the climate difference versus the west coast, northwestern US, or other places***.

But I digress, moving beyond the climate, which will likely kick your ass Texas style. Let's talk about the negatives real quick for people that might travel and like to enjoy things at a personal and human level, not locked behind the wheel of a cage (i.e. car) requiring endless wandering aimlessly through city streets while missing the vast majority of life as it exists. These are the rough parts I'm forewarning you about before you land at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (or if you're brave, arriving by Amtrak's Texas Eagle).

Austin is distinctively slave like in its auto-dependency. People generally can't give you directions except based purely on driving directions. They'll look at you funny if you suggest you might ride the bus or what not. Some people realize that everybody can ride mass transit, but there's still a lot of the culturally discriminatory notions behind transit that has existed in the south. That is, it's considered and anybody riding it is considered the poor and low class of American society (in a society supposedly classless, LOLz whoops). So there's that issue, but, there's relief...

Why do I harp on auto-dependency in this way? It's simple. The more auto-dependent an area the more plain, mediocre, ticky tacky, cerebrally regressive, and generally boring that place will be. One can draw a chart and basically draw the correlation that's tightly coupled to this down to the street levels. Just look at Europe, there's a reason those of historical and intellectual curiosity flood to the old world to explore. But I digress, this issue is a topic that is vast in study and intense in debate, I'll leave this for future topics.

## Bike Friendly What?!

If you're staying downtown or in the immediate neighborhoods it's actually, shockingly, extremely easy to bike around. It's even somewhat bike friendly. The streets, even without bike lanes downtown, are huge. They're so wide they're often able to fit a regular southern mansion (that's big for those that don't know southern mansions) right smack in the center of the street and still have space to walk around.

This is where things get interesting however. Even with the vast auto-dependency working against the livability and liveliness of the city, it counters this by having many walkable spaces. These spaces easily start with downtown and expand out different directions from that point. At the center is the capital building, which is magnificent as capital building generally are.
