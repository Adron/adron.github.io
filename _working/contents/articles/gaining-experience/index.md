Let's talk about gaining experience in the software development part of the technology industry. This might apply elsehwere, but this is specifically about the software development side, since this is what I'm intimately familiar with.

Generally when a software developer gains experience it is done in a few fundamental, particular ways. It's all based on spending time doing a particular activity and interacting with people doing that activity while getting older. Note I've made each an acronym for future writings on this topic, to more easily reference each in the future (which I'll likely link right back here).

1. Language Stack Experience LAEX - A software developer gains experience in a particular technology and language stack; .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, or one of many others. This increases the speed in which a software developer can think through, design, and then develop solutions to problems in that particular stack of technology. This doesn't particular mean the software developer gets better at efficient, clean, or well written solutions to problems, but just how this particular stack is used to solve problems in various ways.
2. Algorithm Experience ALEX - A software developer gains experience with algorithms and how to intelligently, elegantly, cleanly, and efficiently implement solutions based on algorithms within a particular code base.
3. Process Experience PREX - A software developer gains experience working within a particular workflow and process system with other humans. This often shows was to identify, remove, or even in some cases to create inefficiencies, communication practices, or other elements of software development that is done between more than one human.
4. Polyglot Experience PYEX - This is similar to language stack experience, execept instead of a singular stack it covers more than one language and the respective stacks for those languages. Again, it doesn't particular advance algorithm improvements, but unlike gaining extensive experince in a singule stack, it often increases the experience of at least creating solutions with stacks that most efficiently solve a partiular problem.

These are a few that can be defined, and seem like some of the top areas in which almost all of us software developers end up gaining experience over time. It is by no means an exhaustive list of areas in software development. Some others I've noticed over time I've put together here too. These are slightly more rare overall.

* Software Marketing Experience SMEX - Software marketing, or simply marketing for software, is something that is crucial to the overall success and adoption of built software. The ability to market software to it's intended audience, effectively, accurately, and intelligently is extremely valuable experience. It is something that rarely is learned among the developers of the software itself, and is often left for marketers to gain without the insight or knowledge of the actual software or it's history and development itself.
