Ok, previously I'd had a few Metal Monday posts. I'm officially kicking that off again with an extra kicker. Coding problems... but likely not the easy kind. So first, here's some tunes to thrash the mind awake. Then read on for the coding challenge.

First off is ***Unleash the Archers***. I've posted them once before but they've ended up, deservingly, back on my playlist a lot. The band - ALL OF THE BAND - are amazing musicians.

* Brittney Hayes, vocals one can't touch on perfection. Notes are flawless, range is excellent, and she uses the spectrum.
* Grant Truesdell - Tearing it up like a king's guard.
* Brayden Dyczkowski - Holding down the fort like a boss with Grant.
* Scott Buchanan - Beating the skins of the dead.
* Andrew Kingsley - Belting out the demon's vocals, along with support of that guard!
* Nikko Whitworth - Laying down esoteric bass thumping like nobody's business.

The next band I've found myself jamming a number of times lately is ***Toothgrinder***. Especially their new song *The Shadow*. It's got an interesting groover, knarly guitars, clean vocals, distorted vocals, clean psychedelic guitars, and ambient sounds. Yielding the Ashbury Park in New Jersey; Justin Matthews, Wills Weller, Jason Goss, Matt Arensdorf, and Johnuel Hasney lay down some unique music.

...and now for the challenge. If anybody has solutions, estimations of what ought to be the solution, or otherwise let me know [@Adron](https://twitter.com) I'll offer up $100.00 of my own cash to the best solution that you blog or show me that I can blog about! Also, beer is on me if you're victorious!

## The Code Challenge

Given that roadways have three primary functions they're used for: *active transport*, *storage or parking*, and *nil or no use*. Solve for what percentage of time a roadway experiences each. Details are further elaborated on here:

Ask: Well what type of road is it, how many lanes, how many parking spots? What is the layout?

Answer: Here are three types of roads specifically to solve for in a first attempt. These are specified just to have a starting point.

* Country roadway: Two lanes, no parking spaces, and no area to pull off on. Each lane has a capacity of ~800-1200 cars per hour. Traffic on the particular road is about 8000 per day.
* City arterial, 6-lanes: Two lanes each way, one lane parking on each side. Each lane has a theoretical capacity of about ~700-1000 cars per hour (that lane changing brings down the number). Traffic usually is about 12,000 per day.
* Neighborhood street, 3-lanes: Single travel lane in the center, one parking lane on either side. Ability to move about ~500 cars per hour but only experiences about ~1500 cars per day.

The challenge here far exceeds merely some algorithm to solve for X, but instead ponders what would need to be included to find transport use (driving or in movement), storage (parked car), and no car, no movement, and nobody parked anywhere to be seen (and empty road).

...there's $100 bucks and beer on me if you've got answers and the respective code to solve this. Cheers, and good luck thrashing that code!
