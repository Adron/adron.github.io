I opened up Visual Studio Code today with an intent to use it for all my editing, documenting, and coding today. My priorities today, on a day I've taken off from *work*, is to work on my upcoming *Terraform Course*, a little Go coding, and also a few general tasks and notes. While I work on these priorities, you dear reader, get the benefit of my random notes.  ;)

## Shortcut Keys

There are a few shortcut keys I've used so frequently it has become paramount to remember them. Otherwise it's just wasteful trying to look them up over and over.

### Mac OS

* **Word Wrap** `⌥ + z` that's the option key plus the letter `z`.
* **Zen Mode** [ `⌘ + k` ] then `z` which involves pressing the command key and then `z`, then releasing those now that the command key plus `z` state has been initiated. With the IDE in this state, then press `z` and Zen Mode will begin. This is a beautiful experience once you get the shortcut keys down and really want to just look at code, content, or whatever you're thinking through.
* **Explorer** `⌘ + b` that is the command key plus the letter `b` key. This brings up the explorer, in Zen Mode or regular mode.
* **Console** `⌘ + j` that is the command key plus the letter `j` key. This brings up the section of the IDE that has the *problems*, *output*, *debug console*, and *terminal*, with the *debug console* in focus.
* **Terminal** `` ^ + ` `` which is the control key plus the tilde or back tick key and this brings up the previously stated panel, with the *terminal* in focus. Be prepared for this to take a second or two when first opening, as the engine underneath has to initiate a terminal session and is sometimes a bit clunky in starting.

### Linux

* **Word Wrap** `Alt + z`
* **Zen Mode** [ `Ctrl + k` ] then `z`. As the Mac version of the shortcut command, `Ctrl + k` initiates the IDE state, release those keys and then press `z` puts the IDE into Zen Mode.
* **Explorer** `Ctrl + b` brings up the explorer.
* **Console** `Ctrl + j` this brings up the console with the *problems*, *output*, *debug console*, and *terminal*, with the *debug console* in focus.
* **Terminal** ``Ctrl + ` `` which is the control key plus the tilde or back tick key. See above for specifics.
