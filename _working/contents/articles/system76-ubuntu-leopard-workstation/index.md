In the trailing days of 2016, after having moved to Redmond, Washington I sat working at my desktop workstation. This workstation, which still exists, is a iMac with an i7, 16GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, and a 1GB Video Card with a 1TB secondary drive. The machine is a 27" all in one style design, and the screen is rather beautiful. But as I did a build and tried to run Transport Tycoon at the same time in the background the machine sputtered a bit. It was definitely maxed out doing this Go code build, putting together a Docker image build, and spinning it up for go live at the same time my game ran in the background. I thought, this machine has served me extremely well, at over 5 years old it had surpassed the standard 5 year lifespan of peak Apple oomf. At the moment, I thought, maybe it's time to dig into a serious machine with some premium hardware again.

In that moment I thought about the last dedicated, custom built, super powerful workstation machine I had. It was a powerful machine, nice form factor, and easily drove two giant 27" screens. However this machine had lived and finished it's useful life over 6 years before 2016 had even started. But it was a sweet machine, that offered a lot of productive gaming and code writing efficiencies. It was thus, time to get in gear and get a machine again.

Immediately I thought through a few of the key features I wanted and other prerequisites of purchase.

1. Enough RAM and processor power to drive my aforementioned gaming, docker, and code building scenario with ease.
2. SSD drive of at least 1TB with at least a beefy 8GB Video Card.
3. It needed to run, with full support, not-Windows. Ubuntu would be fine, but if any Linux was installed from factory or at least fully supported on the hardware I put together, that would suffice.
4. If I were to buy it from a company, it had to be a company that wasn't some myopic afterthought of 50s era suburbia (i.e. I didn't really want to deal with Dell or Alienware again after the XPS 13 situation). This definitely narrowed down the options.

I started digging into hardware specifications and looking into form factors, cases, and all the various parts I'd need for a solid machine. In parallel I started checking out several companies.

* [System76](https://system76.com/) - Located in Denver, I was curious about this company and had been following them for some time. I had seen a few of the laptops over the years but had never seen or used any of their desktops.
* [Los Alamos Computers](https://lacpdx.com) which is now [LAC Portland](https://lacpdx.com)! - Holy smokes, I had not realized this company moved. They definitely meet the 4th criteria above.
* [Puget Systems](https://www.pugetsystems.com/) is a company located somewhere in the Puget Sound area and used to be called Puget Sound Systems. After digging I found they are located in a suburb of Seattle, in a town called Auburn. I didn't want to rule them out so I kept them on the list and started researching.
* [Penguin Computing](http://www.penguincomputing.com/) is another one of the companies, and kidn of a mainstay of Linux machines. They were a must have in the run up.
* [Think Penguin](https://www.thinkpenguin.com/) is another I dove into.
* [Emperor Linux](http://emperorlinux.com/) is another company I found specializing in Linux machines.
* [Zareason](http://zareason.com/) was another, that specialized in Linux machines.
