I'm working on getting back in the saddle after a great week at HashiConf and a weekend away at Seaside on the Oregon Coast. With that, I haven't had a lot of time to write up day 4, which involved a lot of great talks and conversations. Those topics will come up in some subsequent articles, in the meantime please enjoy these videos I made of my HashiConf Adventures.
