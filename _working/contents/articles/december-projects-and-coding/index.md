As of today I've made a few specific decisions that I'll announce on January 1st of 2017. But for now I've got a slew of other things I'm going to attempt to knock out in the coming days. Hopefully I can make them useful and fun to read, if not, that's cool too since I'll make use of it!

1. If you're a regular reader you'll get a few pieces of my opinion in the next 31 days.
2. The plan is to produce one blog entry per week related to Go around the language, toolchain, and hacking around in IDEs and related tooling.
3. I will be wrapping up several blog entries that you'll see going live over on [Codeship's Blog](https://blog.codeship.com). Topics include a bit o' Jenkins, Go, and what you can get out of Codeship and their respective toolchain and services!
4. 
5. I am putting together some other project work for some un-named companies (primarily because I'm unsure if they'd want me to mention what they're working on at this time, so I'll keep that on the down low). But by proxy I will have some reviews of several technologies.

So mark, and go. We'll all see if I can knock these five things out by the end of December!
