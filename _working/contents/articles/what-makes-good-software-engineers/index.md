Ideas...

Preparing for the Coding Portion:
Make sure to do as many practice problems as you can from Cracking The Coding Interview, and to become very comfortable with data structures and algorithms so you can remember which ones to use during the interview.
This article highlights 6 things you absolutely need to know when doing a coding interview at Google.
www.leetcode.com is a great website you can use to further practice your coding skills.

Tips:
Don't start coding right away. Instead, ask clarifying questions. Many of the interview questions are deliberately underspecified as our interviewers are looking to see how how you approach the questions and how you come up with solutions to problems.
Think out loud and explain your thoughts to the interviewer as you come up with answers to their questions. We are not only evaluating your technical abilities, but also your communication skills.
Do not hesitate to build upon your answer/solutions if you think of ways they can be improved or made more efficient.  In many cases, the first answer that springs to mind may not be the most elegant solution, but it is important to find the most efficient solution you can identify for the problem.
Last but not least: incorporate feedback, test your code, identify corner cases, and be prepared to perform a Big O notation to calculate the complexity of your problem.

Preparing for the Developer Relations Portion:

Tips:
Make sure you understand what a Developer Programs Engineer does:
Developer Programs Engineers are Engineers who specialize in understanding developer communities. They work on open source projects, and write code to help create magical experiences for developers using Google products. They also provide targeted feedback on how a product can be shaped to meet the needs of the developer communities they work with.
Reflect on your background, and how it relates to the job description. Think through questions like: Why Google? Why are you qualified for this specific role? Why are you interested in it? Why Developer Relations?
Keep the developers in mind in all your answers - how can you make sure they have an amazing experience using our products?
