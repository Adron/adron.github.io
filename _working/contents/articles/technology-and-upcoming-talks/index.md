I've started a new effort to line up some meetups to talk about what I've been working on the last few months. This is some cool stuff everybody, so I hope you're ready for the deluge! Here are the first dates of many meetups and some conferences I'm lining up to speak at. I'll be diving into a host of technologies; Terraform, AWS, GCP, Azure, Drone.io (CI in general), continuous delivery, practices, and a whole lot of other systemic things.

In addition to these dates, if you'd like me to swing by and speak, demo, or show some of this technology I've got a fairly open schedule and would be happy to schedule more.

# [Infrastructure as Code and Containers](/talks/infrastructure-code-containers/)

This talk is at [Cloud Power](https://www.meetup.com/mscloud/events/243273397/) on **Tuesday, October 3rd, 2017**. I'll be covering a fairly wide slice of tooling, to build out infrastructure on Azure with Terraform, and stepping beyond initial infrastructure into some basic running services for development, with a server or two. Additionally we'll talk about immutable infrastructure as a concept, how to gain advantage from it, and where it breaks down.

For more details from this talk, check out the details page I've created [here](/talks/infrastructure-code-containers/).

# [The Joy of Coding](/talks/joy-of-coding)

[WVSE - Willamette Valley Software Engineers](https://www.meetup.com/WVSE-meetup/events/241117362/) on **Thursday, October 5th, 2017**. At the WVSE meetup I'll be presenting "[The Joy of Coding](https://www.meetup.com/WVSE-meetup/events/241117362/)" inspired by none other than Bob Ross!

> Today, Let's put a little warm glow in our development....Let's make some happy Code!  
> Your Infrastructure is your friend, take care of it, make love to it... treat it good.  This is your world you can create anything you want.  Maybe there's a line of code... right there... oh, not too much...  there it is!  
> The code is right there in your imagination, you just have to push it out...  there! 
> Remember, we don't make makes mistakes, only happy accidents.
> Shoot... let's have some fun!!

# [Inception, Workflow, to $Deployed$ Removing Chaos and Noise From Your Dev Stack](/talks/inception-workflow-deployed/)

[.NET Developers Association](https://www.meetup.com/NET-Developers-Association-Westside/events/242573016/) on **Tuesday, November 7th, 2017**.

Using a range of tools (Terraform, Azure, Rancher, Docker, etc) I'll show the full build of a dev stack in just a few short minutes in Azure. Then I'll take everyone for a whirlwind tour of development within one of these lean built stacks, using various languages and stacks. I'll wrap up with new app and service deployment into this automated environment to show the entire workflow of the cycle. In the end, this will be a working example of how to use the leanest, meanest technology to date for rapid, high quality development.

# [Your Full Dev Stack and Infrastructure in 30 Minutes or Less](/talks/cicd-in-30-minutes-or-less/)

This talk isn't scheduled just yet, but I've put together a showcase of technology that shows how to go from nothing to full stack, first deploy to production, development and infrastructure implementation. All rolled into a compact talk with demo, sample, and walk through of the ideas, thinking behind the implementation, and more.

As always, I have some collateral for the talk available. You can check that out [here](/talks/cicd-in-30-minutes-or-less/).

If you'd like to learn more, let's talk about lining up a talk date. Cheers!
