I've started a new effort to line up some meetups to talk about what I've been working on the last few months. This is some cool stuff everybody, so I hope you're ready for the deluge! Here are the first dates of many meetups and some conferences I'm lining up to speak at. I'll be diving into a host of technologies; Terraform, AWS, GCP, Azure, Drone.io (CI in general), continuous delivery, practices, and a whole lot of other systemic things.

In addition to these dates, if you'd like me to swing by and speak, demo, or show some of this technology I've got a fairly open schedule and would be happy to schedule more.
