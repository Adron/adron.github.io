In the coming months as I put together technical training material, I've created a fictitious team that is made up of the following members. I've detailed their roles and provided photos of these individuals, that act as NPCs in creating projects for the training material. To add character to the narrative I'll be discussing these roles as if from the perspective of these NPCs that are filling the particular roles.

<em>Meet...</em>

<span class="more"></span>



* <div class="image float-right"> [![Keartida](keartida.jpg)](https://github.com/Keartida)</div> She is handling the role of Senior Software Developer for the projects coming up. She'll be working through the code using pair programming, test driven development, and behavior driven development approaches with the team. She's a master of algorithms and can think through a problem in remarkably short order. She also has a love affair with math, with scientific methods being icing on the cake.

* <div class="image float-right">[![Norda Llah](nordallah.jpg)](https://github.com/NordaLlah)</div> She'll be handling the graphic design, user experience, and related user interface wrangling for the projects. She'll also be working through the workflow to bring the project collateral into source control and provide top tier interface components for the project. Norda has won more than a few art contests, sketch competitions, and other competitive forms of art creation - a somewhat unique and inspired approach to her work.

* <div class="image float-right">[![Etart Sechro](etart.jpg)](https://github.com/Etart)</div> He'll be handling the data science, data analysis, structure, data diagrams, related design and database tooling that will be implemented. If it's a relation database, key value store, graph database, geo mapping store, or whatever else might come up, Etart is going to be the key mover for the data aspects of the projects. He's also a huge fan of high quality suits. If it's quality, he's the man who likes to ensure it will be achieved.

* <div class="image float-right">[![Oi Elffaw](oi.jpg)](https://github.com/OiElffaw)</div> Oi will be handling the wrangling of all us cats working on the project. He's the project manager and organizer of efforts, but more importantly he'll be clearing roadblocks and making sure the team can move forward without interruption. Having gotten plenty of things done in the military, he know's how to get roadblocks removed, nothing like bureaucracy to learn the inroads of road clearing.

* <div class="image float-right">[![Nitsirk Naizom](nitsirk.jpg)](https://github.com/NitsirkNaizom)</div> She's the captain of this ship. She's complete and total awesomeness. She'll be commanding and bringing in the business for the project, and making sure company partnerships align right with the projects and the whole host of things that a CEO takes care of.

* [Adron](https://github.com/adron) Well that's me...  I'm not really an NPC, but I'll of course be playing the part of programmer and puppet master to all of these characters that I've created to build out the [Thrashing Code Organization](https://github.com/ThrashingCode) (a real and fictitious company).

## Project "<em>Wookie Flika</em>"

<h2>Project "<em>Coder Swap</em>"</h2>
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/ThrashingCode/coder-swap"><img class="alignright" src="http://photos.adron.me/photos/i-Jc4Lnkv/0/O/i-Jc4Lnkv.png" alt="" width="128" height="128" /></a>More about this soon, as this series will be covering the team (i.e. the Thrashing Code Team) that I've just introduced. So stay tuned, subscribe, <a href="https://twitter.com/adron" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a> and onward we go. I'll be looking for people to help out with some parts of this project over time. For example, I'd love to have an Erlang, Go, and related stacks fronting some API end points over time. But more on that as we go...  if you'd like to help out though, ping me on twitter or email me and we'll sync up. Maybe we'll put together some non-NPCs to build some of this.</blockquote>
<em>Cheers!</em>
