At Pelotech, and at many companies I've helped out in the past, we've worked to make hiring new team members easy, accurate, win-win, and effective. *Easy* in the overall sense, which is often a huge struggle considering the scope of efforts that go into hiring solid talent. *Accurate* in the sense that we hire people that we can actually use on our team, *idle hands are*, well, there's a saying for that. *Win-win* in literal terms, we want to have a successful hire, and we want the hire to have a successful work environment and opportunity. *Effective* in that we all want to succeed; the employee should succeed for themselves and the company, the company should succeed by bringing on someone good, and the team and fellow cohort should win with the addition of the individual candidates effectiveness.

With all that stated, there are two jobs that I want to define specifically that I'd like to define the role and its scope. The first, which is this post, will be about the *developer advocate* role. The next post on this topic will be about the *software engineer* role.
