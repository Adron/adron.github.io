This is a collection of links and related things that I have used for learning React this last two weeks. I've attempted to sort them into a way that seems useful, at least to me, and hope that this can be useful to others. Where the link was given via Twitter, I've embedded to tweet so it gives reference to those that have helped me along the way. Others are just inline as I found them via google or whatever means.

These materials actually step through or explain in detail design and implementation concepts behind React or various parts of React.

Babel Handbook > https://github.com/thejameskyle/babel-handbook/blob/master/translations/en/README.md

This is actually broken down into the *Babel Handbook* and then the *Plugin Handbook*.

Here are some links I've found that I'm currently working through as examples. They're fairly useful in the context of getting some hands on experience just putting something together that is simple, works, and can be built off of.

* [CURD Application with React Sprintboot & User Auth](https://stormpath.com/blog/crud-application-react-spring-boot-user-authentication) by Karl Penzhorn [@gostormpath](https://twitter.com/gostormpath) with a [repo on Github](https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-spring-boot-react-example)... two other good entries I've reviewed are [Build a React App With User Auth](https://stormpath.com/blog/build-a-react-app-with-user-authentication) and [Optimize React with WebPack](https://stormpath.com/blog/optimize-react-webpack).
* [Building a CRUD App Using React, Redux, and FeatherJS](https://www.sitepoint.com/crud-app-react-redux-feathersjs/) my Michael Wanyoike ([@myxsys](https://twitter.com/myxsys)).
