Recently I started researching what people think DevOps means. What it was originally intended to mean, and how ridiculous it is to actually see it in a job title. On the flip of that, since one of my titles is actually "Site Reliability Engineer" I started looking into what is perceived to be the roles of that job. This article is my findings, in full unconstrained wording, about the absurdity of one as a title title and the specifics of the other.

## Part I - DevOps is... Nope

In linguistics the word DevOps is generally considered a *blend word* or a *portmanteau*. It's the combination of developer or development and operations. Meanwhile, Google actually understands what it is. But hey, we know Google is basically a smarter than humanity AI at this point right? Well, ok, maybe Google's definition of DevOps isn't 100% spot on, but it's fairly close to its perceived meaning.

Google's definition reads, "DevOps (a clipped compound of development and operations) is a culture, movement or practice that emphasizes the collaboration and communication of both software developers and other information-technology (IT) professionals while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes."

Part of that definition also takes it into account that come companies have no clue what the fuck they're doing. Hiring a "DevOps Engineer" and then they end up throwing that person into the fire of systems administration menial servitude or the absurdity of cluster fucked crossed wires network administration. So often a DevOps Engineer is hired without a company, human resources department, or management having any idea that DevOps was and is mostly focused around an idea more than any practice or notion. Sure, some of the practices we undertake are specific, but the idea is more important. It's the combination of development and operations into a focused effort instead of being two battling organizations.

But has that even really happened? In most offices DevOps has grown into another segmented, broken, and often dysfunctional group autonomous of both operations and development. Where the DevOps engineers may be creating automation or who knows, maybe just off drinking in the corner, ops doesn't know because they're fighting fires and development doesn't have any idea because they're building flame throwers to put the fires out.

If you want to get super pedantic about DevOps and what it might mean, check out the Wikipedia or go get your google-fu karate ninja chops going and make up your own definition from the various sources. I'm sure it would be super entertaining! ...or not?

Suffice it to say, DevOps hit full buzzword bingo status a few years ago now. Now it exists in that strange limbo of *worthless buzzword* and *relatively useful in a relative way*.
