Ok, we have several different scenarios and you're the boss. Here are the scenarios for the projects you're working on:

* You have team of 4 people. All developers by trade and experienced. The team may, about 20% chance in the coming 3-6 months, grow to ~8 people, with 1-2 of those being automation experts that could prospectively manage CI/CD systems.
* Another team has 33 developers, 4 are site reliability with 2 more working with them frequently on systems automation. No real growth for the team in the next 2-3 years.
* The third team is 4 people, pairing, that have the highest output and quality of the rest of the teams. Largely because they work well together but also they have minimal technical debt and can move quickly.
