**Notes & Thoughts on Go:**

So far I like Go. Primarily because it is just simple. Simply RTFMing it gets one pretty far without any fuss. The hardest part of the language to grasp seems to be the same things I often have issue with, which is the ecosystem has it's own conventions are related things one just simply doesn't *know*. It involves going through the docs and just remembering where the GOPATH is, where the build files go, what the go commands do with the toolset, and related things.

One thing that required a bit of fiddling around with to get figured out was writing tests for Go. The convention to mark tests and have the executed is actually super easy once you know the specifics of the toolchain.
