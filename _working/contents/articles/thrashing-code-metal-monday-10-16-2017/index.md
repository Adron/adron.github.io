It's not Monday anymore, but we still need some heavy music to debug to. Late better than never, here's the fire.

Flip this around to some In This Moment with a flashback to the... ya know, previous decades.

A little more hard core to sprinkle on it.

Because I know you love some Disney Frozen and heavy music, here's a treat for ya.

# Code Challenge

This is a crazy reverse engineering challenge. Take a look at some of these resources and determine how to find the price and price trend of Seattle housing prices.

* [All-Transactions House Price Index for Seattle-Bellevue-Everett, WA](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ATNHPIUS42644Q)
* [Redfin Housing Prices](https://www.redfin.com/blog/data-center)
* [Trulia Heat Map of Seattle area housing prices](https://www.trulia.com/home_prices/Washington/Seattle-heat_map/)

Basically determine what the average housing price is and determine an algorithm that you'll use to determine the growth for the year.

## WINNER WILL WIN!

If you provide this in a repo (F#, Go, JavaScript, Haskell, Clojure, Rust, whatever your choice) the top solution (like the top 2 if that many try) will get a ticket to [ML4ALL](http://ml4all.org/)!

## ANOTHER WINNER WILL WIN!

If you offer up a machine learning solution (algorithm choice, gathering of data, etc, python, or R, or whatever) you'll also get a ticket to [ML4ALL](http://ml4all.org/)!

All the luck to ya. Hacking time!
