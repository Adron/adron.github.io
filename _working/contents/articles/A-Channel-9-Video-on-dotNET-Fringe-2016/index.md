I was working on some code and related infrastructure configurations at [Albina Press](https://workfrom.co/albina-press) today. But took a short break to join [Troy Howard](https://twitter.com/thoward37) and [Glenn Block](https://twitter.com/) to speak with [Seth Jaurez](https://twitter.com/sethjuarez) [Golnaz Alibeigi (even though she was hiding, she was there!](https://twitter.com/Golnaz89) to talk about [.NET Fringe](http://dotnetfringe.org/).
