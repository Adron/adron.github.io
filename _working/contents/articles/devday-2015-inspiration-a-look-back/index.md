So far this year, which is obviously nowhere near finished yet, I have had some amazing experiences. From <a href="http://dotnetfringe.org/" target="_blank">.NET Fringe</a>, <a href="http://www.polyglotconf.com/" target="_blank">Polyglot 2015</a>, <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6859-progressive-dotnet-2015" target="_blank">Progressive .NET Tutorials 2015</a>, to <a href="http://devday.pl/" target="_blank">Dev Day 2015</a> and more. I decided to add a little bit more of a personal note in this blog entry because of inspiration I just got from Michał Śliwoń (<a href="https://twitter.com/mihcall" target="_blank">@mihcall</a>) on his <a href="http://blog.mihcall.com/2015/09/30/DevDay-2015/" target="_blank">Dev Day 2015 Aftermath</a> write up.

Just as Michał writes,

> "Inspiration is like a spark. It can be one brilliant presentation at the conference, one sentence at some session, one hallway conversation with another attendee and I'm excited, coming back with a head full of new ideas. Every conference has this little spark"

and I completely agree. At .NET Fringe I got back into a few things on the .NET CLR stack, namely <a href="http://compositecode.com/2015/04/19/truly-excellent-people-and-coding-inspiration/" target="_blank">F# and a little toying around with Akka .NET and micro-services using those technologies</a>. I also had a hand in organizing and the origins of the conference, which <a href="http://compositecode.com/2015/04/10/the-idea-of-net-fringe/" target="_blank">I wrote about</a>. At Polyglot 2015 my desire increased to become more familiar with and comfortable with functional programming languages. At the Progressive .NET Tutorials I was again inspired to dive deeper into functional languages and take a look more closely at everything from <a href="http://weave.works/" target="_blank">Weave</a> and other container and virtualization based systems.

## Thrashing Code News

One things that this led me to, is to start putting together a list of people who are interested in these types of conferences. I'm talking about the really down to earth, nitty gritty, get into the weeds of the technology, and meet the people building and using that technology everyday conferences. This list, you can sign up for <a href="http://compositecode.com/thrashing-code-news/" target="_blank">here</a> and do <a href="http://compositecode.com/thrashing-code-news/" target="_blank">read the article just below the sign up page</a>, as this is NOT some spam list. I'll be putting in real effort and time to put together good content when the list officially kicks off! I will blog about, and of course get that first email out about <a href="http://compositecode.com/thrashing-code-news/" target="_blank">Thrashing Code News</a> in the coming months.

Again at Dev Day I was also inspired by many people and got to meet many people. Which leads me to the number one thing that makes these conferences absolutely great. It's all about the people who attend.

## The People

I got to meet Rob Conery (<a href="https://twitter.com/robconery" target="_blank">@robconery</a> / <a href="http://rob.conery.io/" target="_blank">http://rob.conery.io/</a>). We hung out, had beers, talked shop, talked surfing, talked tech and training screencast, discussed future bad ass conferences (again, sign up to my list and I'll keep you abreast of any mischievious conference Rob & I dive into) and tons more. It was seriously kick ass to meet Rob, especially after not getting a chance to at what must have been a gazillion conferences he and I have both been at before!

I finally met Christian Heilmann (<a href="https://twitter.com/codepo8" target="_blank">@codepo8</a>) who I also think we must have both been at a gazillion of the same conferences and somehow managed to not meet each other. Good conversation, talk of Seattle, other devlish code happy things - and hopefully a beer or two to be had with good Christian in the near future in Seattle or Portland (or thereabouts).

I had the fortune of running into Alena Dzenisenka (<a href="https://twitter.com/lenadroid" target="_blank">@lenadroid</a>) again doing what she does, which is tell, teach, and show people a whole of awesome F# handiwork. For instance at Dev Day she was throwing down some machine learning math and helping to get people started. She's also got <a href="http://compositecode.com/2015/09/11/functional-programming-machine-learning-reactive-interactive-visualization-mbrace-and-net-unboxing-tour-of-cascadia-and-dallas-w-alena-dzenisenka/" target="_blank">some talks lined up near the Cascadian (that's Seattle and Portland, but also San Francisco and Dallas!!) lands if you haven't noticed</a>, so come get inspired to sling some functional code!

On day one the keynote by Chad Fowler (<a href="https://twitter.com/chadfowler" target="_blank">@chadfowler</a>) was excellent. I'd not realized he was a fellow who escaped the south like I had all while playing a bunch of music! I was able to catch Chad and chat a bit on day two of the conference. His presentation was great, and he's motivated me to give his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Passionate-Programmer-Remarkable-Development/dp/1934356344" target="_blank">Passionate Programmer</a> a read.

Another individual who I'd been aiming to meet, Mathias Brandewinder (<a href="https://twitter.com/brandewinder" target="_blank">@brandewinder</a>), was also at the conference. I even attended some of his workshop and learned a number of things about F# and machine learning. I'm definitely inspired to dig deeper into many of the machine learning realm and start figuring out more of the truly amazing things we can do with computers and machine learning algorithms - I honestly feel like we've only skimmed the surface for much of this technology. Mathias also has a book, that is truly worth buying titled "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1430267674" target="_blank">Machine Learning Projects for .NET Developers</a>". If you're curious, yes, I have the book and am working through it steadily!  :)

Gary Short (<a href="https://twitter.com/garyshort" target="_blank">@garyshort</a>) provided an amazing talk on digging into crop yields via the European Space Agency Data Science Project. I also enjoyed the multiple conversations that I was able to have with Gary from the talk of "really really really awesomely excited Americans" vs. "excited Americans" all the way to the talks on the matter of data science and crop yields themselves. Gary's talk is linked below, so get a dose of the crop yields yourself, and any complaints be sure to send to his <a href="https://twitter.com/robashton" target="_blank">@robashton</a> twitter account!  (But seriously, you should follow Rob Ashton too as he's got a lot of good twitter nuggets).

Another person I was super stoked to run into again is Tomas Petricek (who I hear might be in the Cascadian lands of the Seattle area in a month or so). I met Tomas at Progressive .NET Tutorials in London and enjoyed a number of good conversations, and his general awesome personality and hilarious demeanor! Not sure I mentioned, but he's got some wicked F# chops too. He spoke about Understanding the World with Type Providers, which is something that you should watch as it's an interesting way to wrap one's mind around a lot of ideas.

I also, after many random conversations about a whole host of conversation in <a href="http://fpchat.com/" target="_blank">Functional Programming Slack</a> (<a href="http://fpchat.com/" target="_blank">follow the link to sign up</a>) chats, got to meet Krzysztof Cieślak (<a href="https://twitter.com/k_cieslak" target="_blank">@k_cieslak</a>). Krzysztof (and if you can't pronounce his name just keep trying, you'll get it right sometime around 2023) was great to meet and catch up with in person. Also great to hear tidbits about what he's working on since he's driving some really cool projects, including working on projects like <a href="https://twitter.com/IonideProject" target="_blank">Ionide Project</a> for the <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom Editor</a>.

There are so many people I enjoyed chatting with and getting to meet, which I really wish I had more time to hang out and chat or hack with everybody more. I met so many other individuals, that I already feel like a prick for not being able to write something about every single awesome person I've had a chance to speak with at Dev Day and the subsequent days after the conference. To those I didn't, sorry about that, drinks and dinner are on me when you're in Portland!
