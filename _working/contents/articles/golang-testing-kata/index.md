I searched and wandered the web. It didn't seem to exist. There are a lot of katas using Ruby, C#, and other languages but not a one in Go. At least, not that a search with variable variances would uncover. I tried "golang kata" and I was left in the cold by ole' Google. So then I tried "golang testing kata", and even "gimme a damn kata in golang google" and finally, a few bubbled up to the top of the search results.

* There is this repo by [Matthias Kadenbach](https://twitter.com/mkadenbach) of a [Mars Rover Kata in Golang](https://github.com/mattes/mars-rover-kata-golang).
* A few finished katas [here](https://github.com/Fluxx/go-katas)
* John Sonmez opining about [why he doesn't do code katas](https://hackhands.com/dont-code-katas/). After reading this it just appears the point of code katas is entirely lost on John. As one of the comments points out "*From reading this, it seems as if you don't understand the difference between kata (or practicing scales, etc) and just doing something over and over.*" and if you read the continuing comments it's a vast swath of people confused as to how he's entirely missed the point. Hmm, sad - also, why does this show up in the results. It's an entirely useless article/blog for a search on "golang testing kata".
* Then I found this kata, which is actually a video of a kata being done. Props! <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nLlcXT8n038" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
* Last on the first page results that actually struck me as crazy useful, and should have been at the top of any results, was this [list of Go Language katas](https://golanglibs.com/top?q=Katas).

With those results done. I watched a few Go Katas and then decided to dive into one of my own. Here's the steps I went through.
