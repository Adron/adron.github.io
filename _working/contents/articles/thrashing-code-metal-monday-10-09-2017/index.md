Alright, this Thrashing Code Metal Monday is going hard core sideways, with something a little different.

First up, which will give you a solid 10 minutes plus of wake up, is [Driving Spain up a Wall](https://open.spotify.com/track/47YfeXei5KhIb05ZqHMW5D) by the creative smash you in the face band [City of Caterpillar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Caterpillar).

Next up is a another kick ass band with [Bad Brains](https://badbrains.com/). Get a taste of early stuff and later material, like one I dig is Rise. There's a bunch of other tunes that are spastic and frantic as you need. Throw around and check them out.

For the last two bands gonna dive in hard core to some local bands that'll ruffle the feathers. Get woke, thrashed, and don't brick your code.

Band > ***Mace***, check out the [demo](https://macehc.bandcamp.com/album/demo), [tour tape](https://macehc.bandcamp.com/album/tour-tape), and other hard core on their [site](https://macehc.bandcamp.com/).

Band > ***Firewalker***, laying out some boot stomping with their [demo](https://firewalkerhc.bandcamp.com/album/demo), [summer-promo tape](https://firewalkerhc.bandcamp.com/album/summer-16-promo-tape), and [Firewalker](https://firewalkerhc.bandcamp.com/album/firewalker).

Now that you're awake. I'm going to throw out an extremely easy challenge this week. I'll also be posting the winning victory prize via [@Adron](https://twitter.com/Adron) if you're game to post a repo with your solution in your preferred language.

# Code Challenge

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous increasing subsequence.

**Example 1:**

Input: [1,3,5,4,7]

Output: 3

Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3.

Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4.

**Example 2:**

Input: [2,2,2,2,2]

Output: 1

Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1.

Also, I'll be posting a link list of code challenges and answers I've posted on subsequent Thrashing Code Metal Monday posts. So answers are forthcoming, the first code challenge was just a bit bigger than I'd originally expected (it's taken me a couple of days to finally write it all up!)
