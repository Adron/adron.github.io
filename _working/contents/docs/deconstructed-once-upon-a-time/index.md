Deconstructed.io was a startup that I founded with Aaron Gray in December 2013. We built a service, effectively a data processing for analytics and identity stitching service, with the capital we raised at the time. However we ran out of capital, Aaron bought the rights to the company to attain sole ownership, and we both went back to the workforce. Woohooo! It was indeed fun while it lasted.
