* `Ctrl + a` moves the cursor to the beginning of all text at the command line.
* `Ctrl + e` moves the cursor to the end of all the text at the command line.

Out of box the `Esc + b` and `Esc + f` combos move one word forward or backward. It's best to change these combos. There used to be ways to remap this but it seems those abilities might have departed for MacOS. So if you've got a hack for that, let me know and I'll update this page.
