![Let's talk about a job?](job.png)

I've added this form to my blog, as I know a lot of people, and I myself am sometimes looking for work. But I only really speak to people about a job, and am only really interested in jobs where I know about the details. To help in these efforts and help get the right people connected to the right job, I've created this form. ***If you're on mobile***, [click here](https://goo.gl/forms/SpzPr2U4V8gon8uh2) to fill out the form.
