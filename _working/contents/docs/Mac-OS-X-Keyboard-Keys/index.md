Here's the actual character for a few fo the keys below. On the right I've included an image with the keys.

* Command:  ⌘
* Option:  ⌥
* Control: ^
* Shift: ⇧
* Control: ⌃
* Caps Locks: ⇪

* `Ctrl + a` moves the cursor to the beginning of all text at the command line.
* `Ctrl + e` moves the cursor to the end of all the text at the command line.

Out of box the `Esc + b` and `Esc + f` combos move one word forward or backward.
