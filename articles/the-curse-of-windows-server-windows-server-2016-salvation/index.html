                <article class="article">
                  <section class="content"><p>Over the last year I’ve worked with <a href="https://homedepot.com">Home Depot</a>, specifically the <a href="http://www.quotecenter.com/">Quote Center</a> Group, strive forward toward a better future. Yeah, that sounds a bit campy, but seriously. I started with <a href="http://blog.adron.me/articles/after-816-days-taking-a-job/">three core objectives, which I wrote about previously</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Community&nbsp;Contributions</li>
<li>Site&nbsp;Reliability</li>
<li>Talent&nbsp;Recon</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve been able to help with each of those things over the last year, with more progress being made on some than others. Right now, I want to delve a bit into the adventure of <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/interview/ben-treynor.html">site reliability</a> at Quote Center. First off, I had the honor of being first guard for Quote Center in the realm of site reliability. I had a lot to do just to set some groundwork on what that position really meant. In addition to the other two <em>roles</em>, err, <em>priorities</em>, it was like taking a job that would have three roles rolled into one. For this article though, I’m going to write about specifically the site reliability and what I did to get some practice and culture around the notion of site reliability at Quote&nbsp;Center.</p>
<p>The first thing, was simply to write out some ideas about what this would involve. Here are a few of my original questions that I scribbled on the&nbsp;matter.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Servers/Instances - Need to figure out where and what servers are magical black magic servers versus fully automated instances? Where be the&nbsp;goodies?</li>
<li>Networking - What’s where and who’s doing&nbsp;this?</li>
<li>Monitoring - What do we know exists, where, and how are we alerted when something goes down? How many things are there? How many could go&nbsp;down?</li>
<li>How does site reliability measure up versus systems admin, network opes, or what not? Who says&nbsp;what?</li>
</ul>
<p>I was working entirely from a blank slate, it appeared the first step would be to get a better definition of what exactly this should cover. One thing I did do was read up on what the notion of Site Reliability Engineer was. I wanted to have a good industry definition of the role. That led to a quick set of resources via Google. Google seems to be the creator of said position, whether they are or not doesn’t matter, because the material they have on the role is excellent. To paraphrase a summary, what an <span class="caps">SRE</span>&nbsp;is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An <span class="caps">SRE</span> is basically a software engineer that is responsible for designing operations functions. This includes interacting with production environments, automation, high availability improvements, monitoring, and more. All approached from a programmatic perspective versus the more traditional notion of hands on systems administration or network administration. Other terms most commonly associated with and responsibilities of SREs include; availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response, and capacity&nbsp;planning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I dove into this work, amid all the other priorities, I was spending about ~15-20 hours a week on the efforts under this priority (or role). This was ok to get things off the ground. Here are a few other key things I put together within the first 6&nbsp;months.</p>
<ol>
<li>We needed action <span class="caps">ASAP</span> to modernize and build on modern cloud infrastructure. I went through working with various partners in the organization to insure that our decisions would work with, or align with, or utilize software, services, and solutions that would jive with corporate. Even though I’d started down the route with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Home Depot made a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-home-depot-cloud-idUSKCN0WO380">higher level decision to move forward with Google Cloud Platform</a>. This was an easy switch to make, because I’d also started a trial with various <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/">HashiCorp</a> tools (Atlas, Terraform, and Packer specifically) that made it a breeze to swap out anything already&nbsp;done.</li>
<li>The next thing was to get some practices put into place to handle change management of infrastructure. I started working on this in the subsequent 3 months but made very little movement forward. This was because my other priorities took precedence during this time - the Talent Recon <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Community Contributions priorities. During this time I worked with Troy Howard (<a href="https://twitter.com/thoward37/">@thoward37</a>) to put on two conferences we’d co-founded: <a href="http://dotnetfringe.org/">.<span class="caps">NET</span> Fringe 2016</a> and <a href="http://nodepdx.org/">Node <span class="caps">PDX</span> 2016</a>. However, even in spite of all those work, I was able to implement another major HashiCorp Server with Atlas. This helped to start shaping our workflow in a tremendous&nbsp;way.</li>
</ol>
<p>This was great, and in that first 6 months I was able to get a lot of traction on those efforts. Then the Windows Server battle&nbsp;started…</p>
<h2 id="the-windows-server-nightmares">The Windows Server&nbsp;Nightmares</h2>
<p>More than a few things we wanted to get deployed using container technology. But because of the limitations of Windows Server around its complete lack of container capabilities and the limited support of drivers within .<span class="caps">NET</span>, our container hopes were dashed for the time being. Even with this in our way of moving forward with containers, we knew it would eventually be the future. So what did we do in the meantime to move forward and build out our microservices&nbsp;now?</p>
<p>The team delved into deployment per Windows Server using a Windows Services Service based approach. In other words, the services you see when you pull up the <span class="caps">MMC</span> on Windows Server? Yeah, that’s what we used in the meantime to deal wtih the lack of container support. This gave our microservices the ability to get deployed with many of the feature notions we wanted and will eventually use with container tech. This however didn’t bode well for immutable deployments or clean continuous integraiton and deployment to Windows Server, and we continued to look forward to a container option in the near future with&nbsp;excitement.</p>
<h2 id="yay-windows-server-2016-to-the-rescue-">Yay Windows Server 2016 to the&nbsp;Rescue!</h2>
<p>Then, enter Windows Server 2016. The news that Windows Server 2016 would have container support was huge. We would absolutely move onto that to gain the advantage of containers if, and only if .<span class="caps">NET</span> Core didn’t gain enough driver and related capabilities that we didn’t get to move to Linux first. You see, if we had our druthers, we’d just move to Linux and forgo Windows Server altogether. But Windows Server 2016 at least provided us a path forward if .NET Core drivers and such weren’t ported before it’s&nbsp;release.</p>
<p>On the flip of all this, you might ask, “<em>why would you deploy .<span class="caps">NET</span> stuff to</em> Linux <em>instead of</em> Windows Server?” There are a host of reasons, and the first that always pops into my mind wasn’t one of our actual concerns, but it is routinely for others. That would be pricing. Holy bajeezuz the licensing costs adds a lot to running Windows Server instances. It makes many multi-<span class="caps">VM</span> solutions cost prohibitive for many solutions, and hopefully containers may change this paradigm more&nbsp;effectively.</p>
<p>If you are in the search for server tech for microservice hosting, suffice it to say, Windows Server is <strong><em><span class="caps">NOT</span></em></strong> particularly the way to move forward unless you have tons of Windows proprietary code base or <span class="caps">IIS</span> demands of some other proprietary demand for Windows Server. There is an extreme minimum of reasons to use Windows Server if you’re trying to deploy and efficiently manage microservices and the related infrastructure, practices, and advantages. The ecosystem, market, and industry as a whole has generally moved onto or has just been using <em><span class="caps">JVM</span> + Cloud Provider + Automation Toolchain</em>. This usually equates to <em><span class="caps">JVM</span> + AWS + HashiCorp Tools</em> or <em><span class="caps">JVM</span> + GCP + Chef</em> or <em><span class="caps">JVM</span> + Azure + Puppet</em>. Most of the future looks something like that. These tools are all dramatically better places to start than using a Windows <span class="caps">OS</span> based environment. But alas, back to the pending salvation of Windows Server&nbsp;2016.</p>
<h2 id="the-other-fix-x-plat-net-core">The Other Fix, X-Plat .<span class="caps">NET</span>&nbsp;Core</h2>
<p>The other solution, post Windows Server 2016, which I look forward to with even more excitement is the ability to run .<span class="caps">NET</span> Core Apps on Linux. The reason, is that the operational characteristics for Linux, especially in a high availability, highly scalable, cloud environment (etc., etc., etc.) are years ahead of the Windows Server solutions at this time. On a cost per server and cost per unit of compute, Linux is easily the winner - and of course that is if you are even dealing with an OS yourself - if you’re in the vmless or serverless game then prices get even cheaper prospectively. However, as is obvious, Windows Server isn’t even in that game, it’s a purely cloud play&nbsp;really.</p>
<p>If you are a Windows Server advocate and you do have legitimate needs to use Windows Server, but still want all the good bits that come along with container technology, Windows Server 2016 is going to be your salvation! Maybe. Soon it’ll even be available in Google Cloud (I hope <span class="caps">REAL</span> soon) and I can spool up a few examples of said OS with said .NET Core bits and then migrate said .NET Core bits directly to Linux! At least, I’m looking forward to doing just&nbsp;that.</p>
<h2 id="summary-how-you-could-help">Summary <span class="amp">&amp;</span> How You Could&nbsp;Help</h2>
<p>As you know, from my article “<a href="http://blog.adron.me/articles/sitrep-home-depot-wrap-up-next-talks-next-job/">Home Depot Wrap Up and Job Talk</a>“, I’ve moved to Seattle and am working on a transition. Quote Center is looking for people who would love to dive into the world of site reliability, working with not just Windows but also Linux, Node.js, and a host of other systems. If you’re keen on joining the team, feel free to <a href="http://blog.adron.me/docs/contact/">reach out to me</a> and I can put you in touch with the right people to get the conversation rolling. Otherwise you can also just check out the <a href="http://quotecenter.com/#openpositions">job descriptions here</a>.</p>
